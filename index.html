<h2>The World of Elements</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Go around the world and learn about the elements!
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
A way to have fun while learning about the periodic table of elements and some basic chemistry!
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
This is a casual adventure game!
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
To get a working game showing properly! Plus movement and sound...
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The player is able to scroll around the world gathering elements to learn about them!
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are a scientist who happens to have access to a tank! You have to drive around gathering elements in order to use them for experiments and keep the world from collapsing!
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The elements have gone crazy and you have to go collect the ones running wild to bring peaceback to the Earth!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
I'm trying to reach any and all people at least old enough to be in elementary school.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
This only takes a couple minutes to read the instructions and play the game (for now).</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I used the Phaser example game "Tanks" as a basis for the game to learn about the movement, plus the diamond image from the basic phaser tutorial.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The Phaser prototype "Tanks" is the most similar since I've used that as a basis to start from.</li>
