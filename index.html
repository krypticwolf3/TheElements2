A way to have fun while learning about the periodic table of elements and some basic chemistry!

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
To get a working game showing properly! Plus movement and sound...
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>The player is able to scroll around the world gathering elements to learn about them!
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, put it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
If the game has a story, summarize it in a paragraph. How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

I used the Phaser example game "Tanks" as a basis for the game to learn about the movement.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The Phaser prototype "Tanks" is the most similar since I've used that as a basis to start from.</li>
